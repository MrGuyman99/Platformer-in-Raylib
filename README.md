# Platformer-in-Raylib
A little platformer written with C++ and Raylib!
**Work in Progress!!**

Features:

- Text based level editing system (Restricted to 1920 x 1080 displays right now, but that is subject to change)
- Other than that, not much!

FOR NEXT UPDATE:

- Character (Maybe not animations, baby steps)
- New tiles
