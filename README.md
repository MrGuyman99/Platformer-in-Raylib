# Platformer-in-Raylib
A little platformer written with C++ and Raylib!
**Work in Progress!!**

Features:

- Text based level editing system (Restricted to 1920 x 1080 window size)
- Pressing space switches levels
- Half-Baked Movement Code
- Four custom made tiles
- Collisions

FOR NEXT UPDATE:

- Jumping (Maybe not animations, baby steps)
- New tiles

For the future:

  - GUI Level Editing System
  - Cool movement tech
  - Actual Level Switching System

That's it! It's simple but I'm proud of how far it's come

Made with ❤️ (& Visual Studio Code)
