# Platformer-in-Raylib
A little platformer written with C++, Raylib, and rlmGui!
**Work in Progress!!**

**Features:**
  
  - GUI level editing system that saves levels to text files
  - Pressing space switches levels
  - Cutom Made Tiles
  - Collisions
  - ImGui and rlImGui integration
  - GUI Level Editing System  
  - Half-Baked Animations
  
**For Next Update:**
  
  - More Levels
  - Actual Level Switching System

**For the future:**

  - Cool movement tech

That's it! The game engine is, at least to my standards, basically finished!!
The only feature missing is a level switching system

**Build Instructions:**

For Linux: 
Download the folder and run `bash build.bash` into the terminal
You NEED raylib installed on linux, I'm not sure if it will compile without it

For Mac & Windows:

**Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è (& Visual Studio Code)**
